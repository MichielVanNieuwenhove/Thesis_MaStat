# Python Notebooks
This folder contains all notebooks for:
* Analyzing the keypoints/quotes pairwise comparisons, and assigning scores based upon these.
* Model creation for classifying the textual data.
* GBD Disability Weights analysis and semantic similarity matching of the symptoms.

The 'env' folder contains the used libraries, 'figs' contains some figures used in the thesis text, and results are the model checkpoints.
