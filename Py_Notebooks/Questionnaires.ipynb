      "Yes, parking, I think... I think they should make a separate parking lot for that day center, because it's six euros every time. And I actually think that's too much for... It's not like I'm visiting, but I can't change that they take such a long time... Sometimes I have to sit in that chair or on the bed for three hours. That's not a mortal sin, but I think 6 euros is too much for actually being a patient, a cancer patient. [...] That's not our choice, so they call it a social rate, but I don't think 6 euros is a social rate.\n",
      "The [name interleukin inhibitor] works very well, I do an injection every 8 weeks, and in any case for Crohn's and Verneuil for the moment it works perfectly. Oh, really. It works very well.”\n",

      "Question 16:\n",
      " I always have to have a toilet within reach. So every time I go, a shop- ah there's a toilet. A city, in that shop, I can go there. So in the back of my mind, because if I have to go, I have to go. So at that time there were such thick sanitary pads. Those pants, diaper pants, that didn't exist back then. So yes, I was always insecure.\n",
      "They explained to me [...] absolutely nothing about what was post-operative... and they didn't ask me any questions.\" [...] \"The surgeon didn't tell me at all during the consultation, that after such an intervention, I had no idea, there are so many weeks of recovery.\" [...] \"No one asked me after the operation if I had someone near me to watch over me, to help me, to uh... and they didn't explain to me that I would need a nurse to change the dressings. They hadn't told me anything.\n",

      "He doesn't have any treatment... Finally... so [name immunomodulator A] that was quickly over, [name TNF inhibitor A] still worked for a long time and then it does... so, I didn't respond to [name TNF inhibitor A] anymore and so when you don't respond to a treatment anymore, well necessarily first you increase the intake, so now, I no longer injected myself every two weeks but every week, and after x amount of time we do it again. No, it really didn't work, so we changed. Then I took another molecule, I don't remember which one. It didn't work either, after... I think that after a year I was already unresponsive and here I am on [name TNF inhibitor B], with [name immunomodulator B], and here we have just done a test again because it's been a month and a half that I'm really not well [...] so I'm at the stage where I'm wondering if it's still worth taking a treatment.”\n",

      "Question 18:\n",
      "Actually, my brother was the reason. A few years ago he had a melanoma and it was surgically removed and that was it. There was no treatment, no follow-up or anything like that. [...] Another reason was also because my sister-in-law died of a melanoma. That made the urgency even greater.\n",
      "That there is a care coordinator or a case manager or that you have a personal coach who can guide you through all phases and not necessarily emotionally. Although I think you shouldn't separate these functions. I think you should have an onco-coach who can do everything. Someone who can follow up on the administrative side for you and, because that shouldn't be too much work, but someone who can do that. But someone who can also provide some emotional support. I think you'd get more out of it in that way. I think a psychologist is more in the second line, and is not necessary for everyone. But having a coach who walks alongside you, who holds the baton for you. I think that would be ideal for me. Who also ensures coordination between first line, second line, contacts, and possibly GP if necessary.\n",

      "Question 19:\n",
      "Yes, we have to move on. So it's actually a combination of circumstances and even during the examination at [name of the hospital], they didn't even know whether it was a primary melanoma or a metastasis. So for me it's really a difficult case, because I believe that technology should be more advanced. That there is still doubt in the final report... but I think that can happen in the medical world, but my brain doesn't understand it.\n",
      "But I also have to say, my oncologist also provided the necessary information. Not only to me, but also to my wife, my children. I think my parents called him once. And he took the time every time to explain it, okay, that's it. Here we are now. These are the treatment options.\n",

      "He's supposed to have a liaison nurse, who manages all the issues.  What I don't know, is whether it's because of lack of resources or... Anyway, she's not very accessible because I don't think she has many hours to handle this. There are a lot of Crohn's patients and so she's a bit overloaded. So there's not really any follow-up of the file, and when you send questions you have to send reminders to get answers, so it's a bit tiring.”\n",
