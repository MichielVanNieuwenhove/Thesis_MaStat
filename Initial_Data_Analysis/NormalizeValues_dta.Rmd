To what scale each variable is normalized does not matter that much. They just need to be vaguely at the same scale.
This, because when asking the experts to rate these we will just rate them at the scale they are at.
For example: what is worse: 1% of people with the disease dying from it or 2.5 million dollars lost.
So if the data is badly normalized the weight assigned to it will have an extremely low or high value, so this balances out.
Probabely at the cost of a bit of loss in accuracy.

We start by automating the process as much as possible and manually filling in the rest.
All possible values for the **UNIT** are:
```{r}
table <- as.data.frame(table(df_dta$UNIT))
kable(table, format = "markdown")
```
